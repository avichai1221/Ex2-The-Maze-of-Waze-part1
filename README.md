# Ex2-java

This project Dealing with the subject directed graphs and contains the classes NodeData, EdgeData, DGraph, Graph_Algo and Graph_GUI.

The class NodeData represents the points in the graph and
The class EdgeData represents the edges in the graph.

The Class DGraph that implements the interface graph and represents a deliberate weighted graph.

The class Graph_Algo that implements the interface Graph_Algorithms and represents a collection
of algorithms on directedand and weighted graphs.

The class Graph_GUI that extends JFrame represent graphic interface.

in this class you can display a graph, save it, run algorithms on it, and display their results.

 On WIKI you can read more detail about all the functions and algorithms that are within the above classs
 and also explanations about the data structure,display
 system and how to use the project,download and run.
